KuoriciniDAO: a token to coordinate community action


KuoriciniDao was created to offer a different approach to how these issues are faced today in the crypto world, introducing a peer to peer feedback game that is not instant and non-transparent (discreet and durable)

We start from the premise that it is not possible establish in advance a predefined feedback rule. Each group is a reality unto itself, each group defines internally both its own roles and the relationship between them. Many aspects are often not formalized on purpose because they would create problems, but this step would be the key to making a group work: a correct recognition of the individual contribution to the collective project. The individual contribution to the collective project must not only be valid in objective terms, indeed perhaps the objective element in this case takes a back seat but above all must be known by the other members of the group. Only there is the trigger for a healthy dynamic of movement of value.
